/*ALGORITHM:
* INPUTS: Backpack Weight
* OUTPUTS: A pretty-printed list of the best items to take from the house to maximize value.
* CONSTRAINTS:
* main():
* Instantiate a Scanner instance to accept user input
* Read in the user's weight limit (must be as a string because Java)
* Check if the weight limit entered is a valid integer.
*   If it is a valid integer, we can proceed.
*   If the input is not an integer, we print an error and ask the user to try again.
* Call generateList() to get the list of items inside the house and their weights and values. Assign the result
*  of the function to a variable.
*
*
*
*
*
* generateList():
* Instantiate a Random object to use to generate the weights and values for each item.
* Generate a 10x3 2D array to use for the items in the house.
*
* */

/*NOTES:
* Should probably mod the object's weights by the weight limit after its randomly generated, so we don't exceed that
* limit with one item.*/
